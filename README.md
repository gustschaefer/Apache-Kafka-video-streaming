# Kafka-distributed-video-streaming

This project is based on https://medium.com/@kevin.michael.horan/distributed-video-streaming-with-python-and-kafka-551de69fe1dd.

The new features of this project are: 
- Temporized video loop (1 second)
- The consumer capture and save every frame of the streamed video in the "frames" folder.
 
Substitute the file "vide_sample.mp4" for a video you want to stream, and then, with the temporized frames, you can take differents approaches, for example:
- Image/Video analyzis
- Image preprocessing
- Image classification
- Noise or anomaly detection
- Train a neural network

So, as you can see, the possibilitys are only limited by your creativity
